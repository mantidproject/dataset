Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~

Comparison operators compare element-wise and *ignore variances*.

   :toctree: ../generated

   less
   greater
   less_equal
   greater_equal
   equal
   not_equal
   is_approx
   is_equal

   is_sorted

`inf` and `nan` handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special-value (`inf` and `nan`) checks.
`inf` and `nan` in the *variances is ignored*.

   isnan
   isinf
   isfinite
   isposinf
   isneginf
   nan_to_num

Reduction
~~~~~~~~~

Reduction operations are operations to remove one or more dimension, e.g., by performing a sum over all elements along a dimension.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated

   all
   any
   cumsum
   max
   mean
   min
   nanmax
   nanmean
   nanmin
   nansum
   sum

Trigonometric

Counts
~~~~~~

"Counts" refers to the default unit of data after histogramming.
It is also known as frequency.
This can be converted into a counts (frequency) density, e.g., for visualization purposes.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated

   counts_to_density
   density_to_counts

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated

   table
   to_html
   plot


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated
