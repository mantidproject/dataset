Release Notes
=============

Changes since v0.1
------------------

* Support for masks stored in ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset``.

* Support for ``groupby``, implementing a split-apply-combine approach as known from pandas.

* Enhanced support for sparse data:

  * Histogramming with "weighted" data.
  * Multiplication/division operators between sparse data and histogram.

* Enhanced plotting support:

  * Now focussing on ``matplotlib``.
  * Multi-dimensional plots with interactive sliders, and much more.

* Significant performance improvements for majority of operations. Typically performance is now in the same ballpark as what the memory bandwidth on a single CPU core can support.

v0.1 (September 2019)
---------------------

This is the first official release of ``scipp``.
It is not yet meant for production-use, but marks a big step for us in terms of usability and features.
The API may change without notice in future releases.

Features:

* All key data structures (``Variable``, ``DataArray``, and ``Dataset``).
* Slicing.
* Basic arithmetic operations.
* Physical units.
* Propagation of uncertainties.
* Sparse data.

Limitations:

* Limited performance and no parallelization.
* Numerous "edge cases" not supported yet.
* While tested, probably far from bug-free.
