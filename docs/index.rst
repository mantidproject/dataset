scipp - Multi-dimensional data arrays with labeled dimensions
=============================================================

**scipp** is heavily inspired by `xarray <https://xarray.pydata.org>`_.
While for many applications xarray is certainly more suitable (and definitely much more matured) than scipp, there is a number of features missing in other situations.
If your use case requires one or several of the items on the following list, using scipp may be worth considering:

- Handling of physical units.
- Propagation of uncertainties.
- Support for histograms, i.e., bin-edge axes, which are by 1 longer than the data extent.
- Support for event data, a particular form of sparse data with 1-D (or N-D) arrays of random-length lists, with very small list entries.
- Support for masks stored with data.
- Written in C++ for better performance (for certain applications), in combination with Python bindings.

Currently scipp is moving from its prototype phase into a more consolidated set of libraries.

Generic functionality of scipp is provided in the core module **scipp**.
Physical units, which are also considered core functionality, are part of the **scipp.units** module.
In addition, more specific functionality is made available in other modules.
Currently the only example for this is **scipp.neutron** for handling data from neutron-scattering experiments.
